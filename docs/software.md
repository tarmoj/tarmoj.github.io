Alongside playing music and teaching, I am a self-taught yet experienced and quite advanced software developer.  

My specialty is **music-related projects**, the most notable being the wireless visual clicktrack system [**vClick**](https://tarmoj.github.io/vclick/).  

I have also created the drone app [**Harmonics Practice**](https://github.com/tarmoj/harmonicsPractice), originally designed to help musicians — especially brass players — practice perfect intonation. It is freely available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.tarmoj.harmonics) and the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/harmonics-practice/id6748588377).  

Another widely used project is the web-based ear training platform [**Digisolf**](https://otsakool.edu.ee/digisolf/), and the [**H5P Solfege**](https://github.com/tarmoj/h5p-solfege) content types for musical dictations and more, created for the Estonian e-learning platform *e-koolikott*. You can read more about [creating exercises](https://github.com/tarmoj/h5p-solfege/blob/main/documentation/creating-exercises.md).  

Andy many more. Feel free to explore my open-source projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/tarmoj/) — they are free to study and use.

I am also the maintainer and core developer of [**CsoundQt**](https://csoundqt.github.io/), the most widely used frontend for the Csound audio synthesis system.  

My main field is **developing cross-platform applications** based on the **Qt framework** and the **Csound sound engine**, but I have also built a number of **web-based applications**, many of them **interactive** or **client-server** solutions.  
  

If you’re looking to collaborate with or hire a developer who understands what artists mean, who deeply knows about sound and music  — please don’t hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:trmjhnns@gmail.com).
